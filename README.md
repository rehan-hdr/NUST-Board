# NUST-Board - in progress


A Digital Noticeboard for my University Campus


## Desc


As per my observation, there is an extreme overreliance of Whastapp groups and word of mouth for the social experience in NUST.
Seeing that, I decided to build this digital noticeboard, which can act as a hub for all the events happening on campus

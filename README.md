# NUST-Board - in progress


A Digital Noticeboard for my University Campus


## Desc


As per my observation, there is an extreme overreliance of Whastapp groups and word of mouth for the social experience in NUST.
Seeing that, I decided to build this digital noticeboard, which can act as a hub for all the events happening on campus


## Basic Features


* Posts sorted by New, Trending or Top
* Categories of Internships/Jobs, Marketplace, CampusEvents
* Filter posts by topics and keywords (in progress)


## Languages/Frameworks/Libraries/Technologies used


* Express.js
* React.js along with ChakraUI
* MongoDB
* Node.js


## Glimpses of the UI
